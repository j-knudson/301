//How to adjust insert function in double linked list to account for three special cases
//1.) List is NULL; 2.) Entry is < First; 3.) Entry > Last
//Answers to special cases
//1.) --> We now need to break our if statement into two separate parts    if list == NULL and if entry < first->data  
//    --> if list == NULL   first = GetNode(item, first, NULL)  --> Call GetNode to make a new node and sicne it is first backwars is NULL
//2.)   If entry < first-data
//      --> first = GetNode(item, first, NULL)  //same as before  we also need to add a new line so that the back field of the previous first node points to the new first
//      --> first->next->back = first; 
//3.) Entry > Last  ; just like with the first two special cases we need to add an extra branch to our insertion 
//      --> if (prev->next == NULL) // check if we are at the last node
//      -->     prev->next = GetNode(entry, prev->next, prev) //call GetNode but since this is the last node we don't need the extra line 


void LinkedList::insert(Item entry)
{
	Node* prev; 	//traveling pointer to find the Node in the list that is directly before the spot (value of entry) the new node should be placed
	if (first == NULL )  //check if the list is empty or if the new value (entry) is now the smallest value in the list and should be first
	{
		first = GetNode(entry, first, NULL);	//call GetNode to create a new node at the first position by passing value of entry and location first
	}
	else if (entry < first->data)
	{
		first = GetNode(entry, first, NULL);	//call GetNode to create a new node at the first position by passing value of entry and location first
